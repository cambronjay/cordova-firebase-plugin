# Cordova Firebase Plugin
This plugin wraps the entire Firebase SDK with an easy to use api and solid documentation.
This plugin will automatically setup your app for use with CocoaPods and then install all the necessary pods.
Open your-project.xcworkspace after you install this plugin and build your app. You will now need to work from the .xcworkspace file.
*** This plugin currently supports iOS and will support android in the next week. Also, typings will be added soon!
***Documentation is coming soon.
